These need to be put inside the B4X internal libs folder to allow support for Android 4.X
You need to remove the current ones.

I did this.

Copy these original files from the 'internal' libs folder to a backup folder
OkHttp.jar
OkHttp.xml
okhttp-4.9.0.jar
OkHttpUtils2.b4xlib
okio-2.8.0.jar

Then copy these older files (HTTP Android 4.x Support) to the 'internal' libs folder
OkHttp.jar
OkHttp.xml
okhttp-3.12.12.jar
OkHttpUtils2.b4xlib
okio-1.17.5.jar
